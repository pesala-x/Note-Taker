## SOAP vs. REST
Web services are all about accessing and exchanging information. These services depend on data protocols, the rules that define how data is handled and moved so both sides of a communication link can understand it. SOAP and REST are the two most popular data exchange protocols.

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

- SOAP is highly structured. It uses an XML data format and typically HTTP or SMTP for data transmission. SOAP is stateful and uses WSDL to describe the web service model that defines how its requests and responses are structured; it includes well-defined security standards.

- SOAP-based web services are easier to consume than REST. They involve more standards and support advanced capabilities such as distributed computing. However, SOAP web services are more complex to develop, implement and support than REST.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
- By comparison, REST is a flexible, stateless protocol that supports data exchange in varied formats. REST is object-based and uses HTTP for key processes such as DELETE, GET, POST and PUT. But REST formally defines little else, allowing data transfers using plain text, HTML, XML and JSON. REST is considered a lightweight protocol that's easier to build and understand than SOAP services. However, REST is typically limited to point-to-point communications, and the lack of deeper standards can lead to performance and interoperability limitations.

- It's important to note that SOAP and REST protocols are both popular and used widely for web services. The question is not which is better, but rather which protocol is best-suited to the web service being developed.
